    using the same account. if you don't have an account you can create a new
    one. you can join as a client to order dishes or as a waiter to look after
    the tables which is already reserved and bring food and drinks to the tables
    or as a cooker to see orders to prepare and also the manager can join to see
    what is going on and he have the right to delete a user off course after taking 
    the necessary measures. Once you login the app check the username from a
    xml file.

    DIVISION OF LABOR

    We have divided the work into 2 main parts
    1-logics and code 
    2-GUI, designing and planning
    Both of us worked on both of the 2 parts but the large size of GUI part was on (Mohamed Kamal)  Where he was designing
    and planning all the screens and the large size of the part of coding was on ( Amr Ashraf) , So  We have distributed the work as follow:-
    1-Reading and writing from file                 
    2-making logic calculations
    3-Gui packages
    4-Rating and Inheritance
    And we worked with each other on the both parts as we had divided the day into 2 periods and in the intersection of the 2 periods
    we contact each other about what is done in the project.
